PUF was originally designed to support *all* information and content as described in the various https://peppol.org/library/[Peppol BIS transactions^], but with the added advantage of adding support for segments/elements that are not present or allowed in the https://peppol.org/library/[Peppol BIS transactions^].

While PUF aim to fully support various Peppol BIS transactions, it will not necessarily be restricted to the same (somewhat restrictive) business rules provided by OpenPeppol.

PUF will, however, always stay compliant to the https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.3.html[UBL 2.3^] structure.

In areas where support for certain information is available in the existing https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.3.html[UBL 2.3^] structure, PUF implements these elements.

In other areas where there are no suitable elements in the existing https://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.3.html[UBL 2.3^] schema, PUF implements `ext:UBLExtensions`.
